### End-to-End Machine Learning Project;

### Problem Statement:
The effect of eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof
area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution) on two output
variables, namely heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of residential buildings is
investigated using a statistical machine learning framework. We have to use a number
of classical and non-parametric statistical analytic tools to carefully analyse the strength
of each input variable's correlation with each of the output variables in order to discover
the most strongly associated input variables. We need to estimate HL and CL, we can
compare a traditional linear regression approach to a sophisticated state-of-the-art
nonlinear non-parametric method, random forests.

#### Data Set Information:

We perform energy analysis using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ
with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution and the orientation, amongst other parameters.
Simulation with various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics is done to obtain 768 building shapes.
The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features - aiming to predict two real valued responses.

#### Attribute Information:

The dataset contains eight attributes (or features, denoted by X1...X8) and
two responses (or outcomes, denoted by y1 and y2). The aim is to use the eight features to predict
each of the two responses - Heating Load & Cooling Load.

#### Specifically:
- X1 Relative Compactness
- X2 Surface Area
- X3 Wall Area
- X4 Roof Area
- X5 Overall Height
- X6 Orientation
- X7 Glazing Area
- X8 Glazing Area Distribution
- y1 Heating Load
- y2 Cooling Load

Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on the Energy Efficiency Dataset and the observations, conclusions derived are under --> \notebook\Energy Efficiency EDA.ipynb

For train_test_split I have used StratifiedShuffleSplit to have the same kind of distribution for Train and Test Sets

#### Steps performed in Model Training:
- loading transformed training and testing dataset
- reading model config file
- getting best model on training dataset
- evaluating models on both training & testing dataset --> model object
- loading preprocessing object
- custom model object by combining both preprocessing obj and model obj
- saving custom model object
- return model_trainer_artifact

#### On the Deployed page to obtain the Predicted Heating Load, Cooling Load:
 - Once the Deployed page is displayed initially we need to obtain our Machine Learning Model by clicking on "Train Heating Load and Cooling Load Estimator".
 - Next, enter the Input feature Values provided in the "Heating Load & Cooling Load Estimation Form"
 - Next, click on the "Predict Heating Load & Cooling Load"
 - The Output Result is tabulated on your screen with all the features and respective values.
